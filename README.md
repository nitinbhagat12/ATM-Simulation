In today's modern world, Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) play a crucial role in providing
 convenient access to banking services for millions of people worldwide. As the use of ATMs
 continues to grow, it becomes increasingly important to ensure the functionality, security,
 and user experience of these machines. This project aims to develop a simulation of an ATM 
 system, providing a platform for testing and refining various aspects of ATM operations, 
 including transaction processing, security protocols, and user interface design. 
 By creating a realistic and versatile ATM simulation, this project seeks to contribute to the enhancement and optimization of ATM technology,
 ultimately improving the banking experience for customers and the operational efficiency for financial institutions."
